<h1>Rigorous Research for Equitable Development</h1>

<p>We conduct policy-relevant research and evaluation across South Asia, specializing in participatory methods, mixed-methods analysis, and context-sensitive approaches that center community voices and drive systemic change.</p>

<h2>Three core principles guide our approach to development research and evaluation across South Asian contexts.</h2>

<h3>Community Partnership</h3>
<p>Research questions, methodologies, and tools are co-developed with communities. We prioritize participatory approaches that ensure research serves those most affected by development policies and programs.</p>
<p><a href="/services/participatory-research" class="cross-link">Learn more about our participatory methods →</a></p>

<h3>Mixed-Methods Excellence</h3>
<p>We combine quantitative and qualitative methods to capture both breadth and depth. Our mixed-methods approach reveals patterns while preserving the complexity of lived experiences.</p>
<p><a href="/services/mixed-methods" class="cross-link">Explore our methodology →</a></p>

<h3>Policy Impact</h3>
<p>Every research project is designed to inform policy and practice. We translate findings into actionable recommendations that can drive systemic change in development outcomes.</p>

<h2>Examples of Our Recent Research</h2>
<p>Examples of our recent research across South Asia, demonstrating our approach to generating policy-relevant evidence.</p>

<h3>Women's Self-Help Groups Study</h3>
<p>A mixed-methods study examining how participation in government-supported SHGs affects women's financial autonomy, household decision-making, and community leadership across rural and peri-urban areas.</p>

<p><strong>Research Question:</strong> "How do different models of SHG support (training, mentorship, credit linkages) affect women's economic empowerment outcomes, and what role do social norms play in mediating these effects?"</p>

<h3>Climate Migration Research</h3>
<p>Participatory research with climate migrants in Chittagong's informal settlements, using photovoice and community mapping to understand barriers to healthcare, education, and social protection services.</p>

<p><strong>Research Question:</strong> "What institutional barriers prevent climate migrants from accessing urban services, and how do community networks and informal institutions fill these gaps?"</p>

<h3>Post-Conflict Education Study</h3>
<p>Longitudinal study tracking educational outcomes and inter-ethnic relationships among youth in post-conflict areas, combining administrative data with ethnographic research methods.</p>

<p><strong>Research Question:</strong> "How do different models of school integration affect learning outcomes and social cohesion in post-conflict communities, and what role do teachers and curricula play?"</p>

<h3>Water Governance Analysis</h3>
<p>Policy analysis and ethnographic study of women's participation in water user associations, examining how gender norms and institutional design affect water governance outcomes.</p>

<p><strong>Research Question:</strong> "Under what conditions do women's water user committees improve both water management and women's political participation in rural communities?"</p>

<h3>Healthcare Access for Displaced Populations</h3>
<p>Ethical research protocol developed with local youth groups to understand healthcare barriers among internally displaced populations, focusing on trauma-informed and culturally sensitive approaches.</p>

<p><strong>Research Question:</strong> "How do ongoing security concerns and displacement affect healthcare-seeking behavior, and what community-based interventions can improve access to mental health services?"</p>

<h3>Digital Financial Services Impact</h3>
<p>Randomized controlled trial evaluating the impact of mobile money training for garment workers, with particular attention to remittance patterns and household financial management.</p>

<p><strong>Research Question:</strong> "Does training in digital financial services increase savings rates and remittance efficiency among internal migrants, and how do these effects vary by gender and origin location?"</p>
